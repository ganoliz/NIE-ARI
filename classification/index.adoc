//==== Alternative and correction tests


//If there exist serious reasons preventing you from writing a test at the scheduled time you can write alternative test. You have also the possibility to repeat your tests if you want to repair its evaluation; in such a case the result of the former test is ignored and the new result is taken. By the end of the semester one common term will be announced for all alternative and correction tests.  +


=== Necessary conditions to get assessment

The aim is to obtain points from 5 homework. Each homework is evaluated with 10 points. To get an assessment, the student has to obtain at least 25 points; the maximum number of points that can be obtained for homework is 50.

== Exam


Prior to sit for the exam the student has to get assessment. All points that he has obtained for the test are included into the total evaluation. The exam itself is written and it represents at the most 50 points. Minimum of exam test is 20.

== Evaluation scale


Evaluation scale is according to http://www.cvut.cz/pracoviste/pravni-odbor/documents/studyandexaminationcode.pdf[The Study and Examination Code for Students of CTU in Prague].
